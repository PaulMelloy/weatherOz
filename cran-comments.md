## URL Check Note

Several URLs are reported as "Forbidden".
This is due to an Australian Bureau of Meteorology policy that blocks any headless access of web resources that are served via HTTP methods but if accessed via a browser, properly respond.
The URLs have all been validated and are considered to be stable and unchanging as a part of a government website.

## Re-submission changes

Fixed Rd link targets missing package anchors.
